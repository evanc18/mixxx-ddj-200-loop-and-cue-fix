# mixxx-ddj-200-loop-and-cue-fix
This is a Pioneer DDJ 200 MIDI controller binding to fix the Mixxx bug on Ubuntu for the cue/play button stuttering and pausing as well as overriding hotcues to loop mode instead. 
By default, it uses 1/8 1/4 1/2 1 2 4 8 16 beat loops


To use, add the binding to the directory /home/user/.mixxx/controllers/ 

Bind the mapping under preferences/controllers/DDJ-200 MIDI

Enjoy!
